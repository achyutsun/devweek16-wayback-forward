#Wayback Foward

(An experiment done at the DeveloperWeek 2016 Hackathon)

The Internet Archive's "Wayback Machine" web archive has a lot of
information about the history of the webpages it has saved. Our
goal is to make this information available and visually attractive.

Our stretch goal is to use some external APIs to do things like
show when a webpage has had large changes made to it.
